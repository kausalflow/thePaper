We [cite the reasons why a publication in Physics is important](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_physics) here.

> Some reasons why a particular publication might be regarded as important:

> * **Topic creator** – A publication that created a new topic
> * **Breakthrough** – A publication that changed scientific knowledge significantly
> * **Influence** – A publication which has significantly influenced the world or has had a massive impact on the teaching of physics.


However, we will deal with much more recent publications and some of them are not so well known. We can add a line of explanation for these publications each.

It's OK to push possibly important publications.
